This resource is designed for individuals with a basic understanding of CodeWalker (discord.gg/codewalker).

If you’re unfamiliar with CodeWalker, I recommend joining their Discord and reviewing the releases and tutorials channels to get started.

The goal of this resource is to provide a blank canvas for those who enjoy creating custom maps and hotspot locations. I’ve removed entities and edited collisions at key spots to offer a clean slate for builders. The foundations I’ve placed aren’t meant to be pretty—they’re simply blocks I’ve put down to give you a starting point. I encourage you to yeet my random foundation and turn it into your own unique project, or improve upon what I’ve started!

If you find any mistakes, please report them properly so I can correct them. Not everyone has the patience or skill to wipe locations as I’ve done, and that’s where this free resource comes in.

I’m passionate about helping others improve and I’m available day and night for those willing to learn. However, don’t mistake this for a willingness to deal with issues stemming from user error or lack of competence. Each resource is free, and I’ve done the hard work for those who know how to use it.
